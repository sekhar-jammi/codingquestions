Static variables or Class variables:
   static variables are declared with static keyword.
   static variables are common to all instances of class.
   these are variables shared between the objects of the class.
   as these variables are shared between objects changes made in one object will reflect in another object..
   static variables are accessed by using class name or object reference..
   
Instance variables:
   instance variables are declared without static keyword..
   instance variables are not common to instances of class.
   each object will have their own copy of instance variables..
   instance variables are accessed only by using object reference.
